###  July 2014

#### - Programming Logic

For some time, the use of computers was limited to scientific projects and to some types of industrial connections.

The power of the computer, its features and capabilities were overlooked by the general public, who did not believe in the possible benefits of its use.

The situation has now reversed. Everyone knows of the importance of the computer in modern life. Even people who did not believe in the computer surrendered to the features and facilities that this technology brought to our daily lives.

In this course we will address the issue of deductive and mathematical thinking, its limits and abstract reasoning. We will start by reviewing some concepts, in order to consolidate their knowledge about how a computer works.

#### - Portuguese - New Spelling Agreement

From the point of view of orthography, there are significant differences in the Portuguese language, and this does not only occur between Portugal and Brazil, but also in the other six countries where Portuguese is the official language: Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, São Tomé and Prince, Angola, Mozambique and East Timor.

One of the main justifications for the creation of the New Orthographic Agreement is the end of the various spellings, giving greater visibility to our language, which is the seventh most spoken on the planet!

In a simple, objective and attention-grabbing way, the three characters of the course present the main changes in the Portuguese Language Spelling, as defined by the New Orthographic Agreement, in force since January 1, 2009.
